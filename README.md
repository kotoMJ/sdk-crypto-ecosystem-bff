# SDK Crypto Ecosystem backend for frontend (BFF)

Case study of BFF for the [SDK ecosystem](https://github.com/kotoMJ/android-sdk-crypto-ecosystem).

## Features

The main purpose of this backend is to handle requests with public API keys together with the Google Play Integrity token
and use them to call services with real API key not exposed via frontend.

Here's a list of features included in this project:

| ----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Routing](https://start.ktor.io/p/routing-default) | Allows to define structured routes and associated handlers. |

## Building & Running

To build or run the project, use one of the following tasks:

| Task                                    | Description                                                          |
| -----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `./gradlew test`                        | Run the tests                                                        |
| `./gradlew build`                       | Build everything                                                     |
| `./gradlew buildFatJar`                 | Build an executable JAR of the server with all dependencies included |
| `./gradlew buildImage`                  | Build the docker image to use with the fat JAR                       |
| `./gradlew publishImageToLocalRegistry` | Publish the docker image locally                                     |
| `./gradlew run`                         | Run the server                                                       |
| `./gradlew runDocker`                   | Run using the local docker image                                     |

If the server starts successfully, you'll see the following output:

```
